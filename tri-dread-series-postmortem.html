<h3>Digital Happiness, B.C.</h3>
<ul>
<li>All of the initial members were from the <b>same campus</b>.<br><br>
<li>We like to <b>play games together</b>, <i>dated back to the early Quake days.</i><br><br>
<li><b>We already dreaming about creating games</b>.
  <ul>
  <li>But there is no gamedev scene back then.
  <li>No available gamedev tools to use either.
  <li>No marketplace for indies beyond <i>Shareware</i> too.
  </ul>
</ul>

  <ul>
  <li>We founded our each own Startup.

<ul>
<li>Our 'Startup' collaborated on a game-like project.
  <ul>
  <li><b>IRIS Design</b>, by Rachmad Imron, produce it.
  <li><b>MALAKA9</b>, a company I co-found, develop it.
  </ul>
<li>To build a car driving simulation software and hardware.<br><br>
<li><b>It was a huge challenge!</b>
  <ul>
  <li>The project requires a <i>believable physics</i> with correct <i>force-feedback</i> on the <i>steering wheel</i>.
  <li>No Unity3D yet, Unreal Engine is no cheap, so<br><b>we build our own game &amp; physics engine</b>!
